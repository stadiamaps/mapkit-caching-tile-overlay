#  Caching MapKit Tile Overlay

A MapKit overlay renderer and associated protocol
that addresses bugs and shortcomings of `MKTileOverlayRenderer`.
If you're having issues with your tile overlays flickering,
or wish they would overzoom existing tiles while loading instead of showing a blank,
you're in the right place!

Check out the [Stadia Maps MapKit Raster Overlay](https://github.com/stadiamaps/mapkit-layers)
for an example implementation.
